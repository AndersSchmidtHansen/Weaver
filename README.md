Weaver
===========

Framework for crafting simple web applications utilizing Polymer elements and Angular.

**Gulp** is modified to:

- Compile **SASS** to **CSS** (structured after MVCSS)
- Compile **Coffeescript** to **Javascript**
- Compile **SLIM** to **HTML**
- Handle creating Polymer elements in a very easy and clean way
- Synchronize and live-reload across multiple browsers and devices through BrowserSync

Weaver leverages the following technologies and methodologies:

- Gulp
- Bower
- NPM
- Angular (with ui.router)
- HTML5 Boilerplate
- MVCSS
- Polymer
- Slim
- SASS
- Coffeescript
- BrowserSync
- UserApp (for easy user registration and management)
